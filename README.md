Docker and Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Setup
1. Create a DockerHub Account
To begin, if you donâ€™t have a DockerHub account, visit DockerHub and sign up. Choose a username that is easy to remember, as you will need it later for logging into Docker through the terminal.

2. Clone the Project Repository
Use Git to clone the project repository you wish to work on. Open your terminal and run the appropriate command for cloning the repository.

3. Install Docker
To install Docker, go to the Docker website and follow the instructions specific to your operating system. If you are using Linux (such as Ubuntu), follow the installation steps provided there.
Note: Be aware of potential permission issues that may arise during installation. Ensure that you grant the necessary read and write permissions to Docker and any related files.

4. Create a Dockerfile
Once you have cloned the project, navigate to the root directory of your project (where the README.md file is located). Create a file named Dockerfile without any file extension.

5. Write Dockerfile Configuration
In your Dockerfile, configure it to set up your container environment. Here are key components to include:
Use an official base image suitable for your application (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).
Set the working directory within the container.
Copy necessary files such as package.json (for Node.js applications) or requirements.txt (for Python applications) to leverage caching during builds.
Install dependencies required for your application.
Copy the rest of your application code into the container.
Expose the appropriate port that your application will run on.
Define the command that should be executed when starting the container.
Note: Ensure that your application has an entry point file (like index.js or app.py) if applicable.

6. Build and Push Docker Image
After creating your Dockerfile, navigate to its directory in your terminal. Build your Docker image using a command that specifies your username and project name. After building, log in to DockerHub using your credentials and push your image to your DockerHub account.

7. Create a docker-compose.yml File
In the root directory of your project, create a docker-compose.yml file. This file should define services for your application, specifying which image to use, which ports to expose, and any necessary restart policies.

8. Start Docker Container
To start your application using Docker Compose, run the appropriate command in your terminal. Once started, you should be able to access your application locally through a specified port in your web browser.

9. Install Jenkins
To install Jenkins, follow the instructions based on your operating system:
For Linux users, utilize the installation script provided on the Jenkins website.
For Windows users, download and install Jenkins using the installer from its official site.
Dependencies: Make sure all necessary dependencies are installed; Java is typically required for Jenkins.

10. Start Jenkins
After installation, start Jenkins. By default, it will run on port 8080. If this conflicts with another application (like your Docker app), change Jenkins' port in its configuration file to avoid conflicts (e.g., change it to port 8082). Access Jenkins through a web browser using this new port.

11. Configure Jenkins
During initial setup, install suggested plugins and create an admin user account with a password. To create a new pipeline:
Name it according to your preference.
Select "Pipeline" as the workflow type.
Configure the pipeline by linking it to your Git repository that contains the Dockerfile.
Additionally, install plugins that enhance integration:
Git plugin for working with Git repositories.
Pipeline plugin for defining Jenkins pipelines.
Docker plugin for integrating Docker with Jenkins.
Blue Ocean plugin for an improved user interface.
Credentials Binding Plugin for secure management of credentials.

12. Finalize Pipeline
Once all configurations are set up in Jenkins, apply and save them.
Your basic CI/CD pipeline is now ready for use! You can now automate builds and deployments for your application effectively.
